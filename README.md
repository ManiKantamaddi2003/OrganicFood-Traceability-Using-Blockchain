## Project Overview
Organic food has a growing market, but ensuring its authenticity remains a challenge. This project provides a blockchain-based solution to record and track each stage of the supply chain, from farmers to consumers. 

### Objectives:
- **Traceability**: Track the origin and journey of organic food products.
- **Transparency**: Build trust among consumers, producers, and distributors.
- **Efficiency**: Simplify audits and verifications using blockchain.

---

## Features
- Immutable blockchain ledger for supply chain data.
- Unique identifiers for each product batch.
- Real-time tracking of product movement and status.
- Smart contracts to automate verification processes.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum (or Hyperledger, as per your choice)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (or any decentralized storage solution)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
